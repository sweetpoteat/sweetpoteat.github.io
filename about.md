    <p class="about-text">I have loved treats since before I can remember! Brownies were always a staple at our house when I was growing up. My step dad used to bake delicious oatmeal chocolate chip cookies when I was little (and still does!). And my mom made the most incredible truffles at Christmas time. Honestly, sneaking treats was one of my favorite pastimes. </p>
    <p class="about-text">When I got married, I wanted so badly to bake a really good chocolate chip cookie. But being completely naive, I assumed I could leave out the oats from my step dad’s oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe. Of course, that ended in tears and disaster. From that moment on, I was determined to learn to bake. </p>
    <p class="about-text">My friend Abby was the first person to show me the ropes. Cookies, pies, breads. She taught me some basics, and fed me enough delicious baked goods to keep my fire burning. I began to really focus on chocolate chip cookies, since they were my favorite. I tried recipe after recipe, technique after technique. For YEARS. When I was finally satisfied with all that I’d learned, I created my own recipe. Then I moved on to truffles and pies and bars. </p>
    <p class="about-text">In 2019 my husband Skyler and I were pregnant with our fourth child and our budget was feeling tight. My friend Stacy encouraged me to sell my treats. I decided to sell pies for Thanksgiving and ended up selling 16 pies. Then for Christmas, I sold even more treat boxes. So in the spring of 2020, I decided to create Sweet Poteat Homemade Treats.  </p>
    <p class="about-text"> Today I sell a lot of treats around the holidays, cater treats for family reunions, make treat favors for parties, showers and weddings, and take orders for birthdays, events and all cravings.  </p>
    <p class="about-text">I’m grateful to all my friends and family who have supported my baking journey. My mom Becky, and my step dad Stuart for inspiring me to love treats in the first place. Abby for all her teaching. Wendy for her years of taste testing. Stacy for encouraging me to start a business. And Emily Florence, without who I wouldn’t have learned to do a proper pie crust. I’m especially grateful for my husband Skyler, who has been my rock and help through all of the years of baking. And I owe everything to God who has helped me develop my talents into something beautiful I can share with others.  </p>
